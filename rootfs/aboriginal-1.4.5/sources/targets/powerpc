DESCRIPTION="
Power PC, 32 bit

Generic Power PC system, a basic unoptimized instruction set which
just about any powerpc should be able to run.

The main exceptions are the 440 and 880 lines, which were stripped down
versions of the powerpc (created by IBM and Motorola, respectively) targetted
at battery powered devices such as cell phones.  They do not support the
entire powerpc instruction set.  (Alas, the two chose _different_ subsets, so
they don't run each other's code either.  These days the 880 is known as
PowerQuic.)
