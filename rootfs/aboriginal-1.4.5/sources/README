The following files live here:

  include.sh: Common code included by every build stage.  Defines many
              environment variables, and sources the various *functions.sh.

  functions.sh: Shell functions internal to Aboriginal Linux.

  utility-functions.sh: Functions usable in contexts other than the Aboriginal
                        Linux build.

  download-functions.sh: Functions to manage package source.  (Download
                         tarballs, confirm checksums, extract and apply
                         patches, manage package cache.)

  timeout.sh: Wrapper to run a command line with a timeout.

  baseconfig-linux: Common miniconfig shared by most architectures, to which
                    $LINUX_CONFIG from the target/$ARCH/settings is appended.

  baseconfig-uClibc: Common miniconfig shared by all architectures, to which
                     $UCLIBC_CONFIG from the target/$ARCH/settings is appended.

The following subdirectories live here:

  native: Files copied verbatim into each architecture's root-filesystem image.

  toys: Various small code snippets written or maintained for this project.

  sections: Package build scripts called more than once during build.sh.
            This is duplicate code factored out into a common location.

  patches: Patches applied to the packages listed in download.sh by "setupfor".
           Each package has "$PACKAGE-*.patch" applied in alphabetical order.

  targets: Configuration for each target platform, parsed by load_target()
           and getconfig() in functions.sh.  Each entry is a target name,
           either a self-contained script setting configuration information,
           or else a directory containing:

      settings: Environment variables needed by the build.

      miniconfig-linux: linux kernel .config compressed by toys/miniconfig.sh

      miniconfig-uClibc: uClibc .config compressed by toys/miniconfig.sh

  root-filesystem: Files to be copied verbatim into the target filesystem.
                   Used by simple-root-filesystem.sh.
